0x11. C - Custom printf function group project

int printf ( const char * format, ... );
This is the first group project that we have at ALX, which consists of replicating the printf (3) function of language c, calling it this way _printf.
The printf function is part of the standard library and to use it we must specify the header file <stdio.h>.
The function writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
